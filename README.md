**3** - Create the PyQT **Skeleton Application** - the root folder.

**4** - Modify these files to make the application functions as desire : **rprename/_int_.py, rprename/views.py, rprename/app.py, rprenamer.py**.




## How to Run
####
**1** - Clone the source code into your PC.
**2** - Open you preferred IDE (**Visual Studio Code recommended**).
**3** - Open the project folder, then open the terminal .
